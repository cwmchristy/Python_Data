#Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
    From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
#You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message). 
#Then print out a count at the end.
#Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'. Also look at the last line of the sample output to see how to print the count.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
